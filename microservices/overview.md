- Conway's law.. software structure follows the organizational  
  structure that uses it
- focus around business capabilities
- decentralized decision making
  - organization
  - software too

- complete automation

- small teams
  - team leader
  - feedback from users directed right to team
    - use in codedepot

- network
  - pipes are dumb
  - just send to receiver.. no central bus/broker
  - endpoints are whats smart

- data
  - decentralized management of data
  - each component get its own data storage
  - each component is responsible for providing data

- assumption of component's failure is built-in
  - also tested for frequently

- requires asynchronous messaging
  - adds critical complexity

- partial deployments and upgrades.. a plus
- availability is good
  - watch out for consistency

- preserves modularity and loose coupling
- polyglot capability built-in
